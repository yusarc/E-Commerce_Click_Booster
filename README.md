# E-Commerce Click Booster Model

This repository contains a step-by-step guide for building an E-Commerce Click Booster Model using Machine Learning in Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project consists of three different Jupyter Notebooks, covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of various machine learning models.

## Introduction

The E-Commerce Click Booster Model aims to increase the click-through rate (CTR) for products on an e-commerce website. By analyzing various factors such as user behavior, product attributes, and historical data, the model can predict the likelihood of a user clicking on a particular product.

This README file serves as a guide to understand and replicate the machine learning processes involved in building the E-Commerce Click Booster Model.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:


- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files with step-by-step code and explanations.
  - `Data_Cleaning.ipynb`: This notebook covers the data cleaning process, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming variables if necessary.
  - `Data_EDA.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on exploring the dataset, visualizing distributions, relationships between variables, and deriving meaningful insights.
  - `Data_ML.ipynb`: This notebook implements various machine learning models for the E-Commerce Click Booster Model. It covers encoding categorical features, separating features and target variables, splitting the data into training and testing sets, scaling features, training and evaluating the ML models, determining feature importance, deriving actionable insights, and performing segmentation analysis.

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for running the code.

## Dependencies

To run the code and reproduce the results, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies using `pip` or `conda` before proceeding.

## Instructions

To use the E-Commerce Click Booster Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Start with the notebook titled `Data_Cleaning.ipynb` and follow the step-by-step instructions to clean the data.
5. Proceed to the notebook `Data_EDA.ipynb` to perform exploratory data analysis and gain insights.
6. Finally, move to the notebook `Data_ML.ipynb` to implement machine learning models for the click booster. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to encode categorical features, separate features and target variables, split the data, scale features, train and evaluate ML models, determine feature importance, derive actionable insights, and perform segmentation analysis.
7. Optionally, modify the code and experiment with different techniques to improve the model's performance.


Note: It is recommended to run the notebooks in sequential order, as each notebook builds upon the previous one.
